# PyBer_Analysis



Purpose of Analysis:
Use Python to create a summary data frame of the provided ride-sharing data by urbanization level. Then, create a line chart depicting weekly fares for each level of urbanization. 

Deliverable 1:
Join City-Data and Ride-Data together so that we can deduplicate and perform our various aggregations. 
Aggregations include, 
•	Total Rides by city type
•	Total Drivers by city type
•	Total Fares in us-dollars ($) by city type
•	Average Fare per Ride for each city type
•	Average Fare per Driver for city type

Deliverable 2: 
Derive additional attributes based on the merged data frame from deliverable 1. Restructure the data frame using the date-time field as our index. This allows us to create a descending order pivot table of dates, ranging between the beginning of January 2019 through the end of April 2019.

Results: 
There is a definite disparity in both fares and ridership in the rural locals. Additionally, between urban, suburban, and rural, there is correlated seasonality in fares with a dip in early January, a slight increase between end of January and early February, and a dip again in early March.

Recommendations based on Analysis:
1.	Boost Rural Fares and Rides.  The rural numbers are dramatically lower than both urban and suburban locals. Recommend implementing incentives to promote an increase in rural driver numbers. 
2.	Boost the dips: Recommend a ridership incentive or cost reduction in the seasonally occurring dips in early January, Mid-February, and early March. 
3.	Recommend futher analysis for Urban Fares and Riders to determine the reason for such dramatic spikes and dips in fares week-over-week for April
